# Dccp-Eiris


IRIS was the goddess of the rainbow and the messenger of the Olympian gods. She was often described as the handmaiden and personal messenger of Hera. For the coastal-dwelling Greeks, the rainbow's arc was most often seen spanning the distance between cloud and sea, and so the goddess was believed to replenish the rain-clouds with water from the sea.

Her name contains a double meaning, being connected with both the Greek word iris "the rainbow" and **eiris** "messenger."
