# Eiris


IRIS was the goddess of the rainbow and the messenger of the Olympian gods. She was often described as the handmaiden and personal messenger of Hera. For the coastal-dwelling Greeks, the rainbow's arc was most often seen spanning the distance between cloud and sea, and so the goddess was believed to replenish the rain-clouds with water from the sea.

Her name contains a double meaning, being connected with both the Greek word iris "the rainbow" and **eiris** "messenger."

Iris was also one of the chief divine messengers of the gods, alongside Hermes. In early mythological literature, Iris carried the messages of the Olympians—especially Zeus—to other gods as well as to mortals.
